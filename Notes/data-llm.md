# 🔗 Cisco Live 2025 – Connecting Your Data to LLMs

**Speaker**: Cisco Innovation Strategy Team  
**Transcript**: [Otter.ai Full Transcript](https://otter.ai/u/HcpiP8nz8i0CiIvRY4KQaQMgjsA)  
**Topic**: Architecting secure, agent-based data access for LLMs inside the enterprise

---

## 🎯 Session Overview

This session focused on how to connect enterprise data to Large Language Models (LLMs) securely and compliantly using **agentic information retrieval**, identity binding, and function calling. It emphasized overcoming **legal, regulatory, and access barriers** while enabling scalable agent collaboration across trusted data pipelines.

---

## 🚀 Key Action Items

- [ ] Explore the **open-source identity management system** for agent collaboration
- [ ] Track the progress of the **global Agency initiative** launched in March
- [ ] Review agent use cases for internal AI assistants (e.g., sales, dev support)
- [ ] Investigate data localization and **GDPR/CCPA compliance strategies**

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Architecture

### 🔹 Enterprise Strategy
- Cisco’s approach: **Invest, buy, partner, incubate**
- Lean teams focused on MVPs and agile development

### 🔹 Why Connecting Data Matters
- LLMs without your data = generic output
- Connecting **real-time + historical data** = contextual, useful AI

### 🔹 Barriers to Integration
| Challenge | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🛑 Legal & Compliance | GDPR, CCPA, internal data governance |
| 🧩 Identity Binding   | Mapping user roles to permissions, context |
| 🧱 Data Silos         | API fragmentation, region-specific storage |
| 🔐 Security           | Encrypted transport, zero-trust APIs |

---

## 🛠️ Agentic Information Retrieval

A smart, layered approach to accessing enterprise data through **autonomous agents** and identity-aware APIs.

### Architecture Components:
- 📎 **Identity Binding**: Agents know “who” is asking + access rights
- ⚙️ **Function Calling**: LLMs trigger API calls based on user intent
- 🕸️ **Agent Collaboration**: Agents share knowledge via secure protocols
- 🔐 **Data Access Rules**: Region-specific filters (GDPR, localization)

---

## 📦 Use Case Examples

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🧑‍💼 Sales Assistant | Pulls product availability + pricing based on region |
| 👨‍💻 Developer Bot | Retrieves internal documentation, tickets, or logs |
| 👩‍⚖️ Legal AI Judge | Tested internally – legal hurdles blocked deployment |
| 🤖 Multi-Agent API | Different agents pass tasks securely between APIs |

---

## 🔓 Open Source + Future Outlook

- ✅ Cisco **open-sourced agent identity component**
- 🌐 Global **Agency Project** (March 2025) promotes secure agent interoperability
- 🔮 Goal: Build **open, scalable, compliant agent networks** that work across teams and platforms

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

> “Without secure, compliant access to enterprise data, LLMs are just good guessers. Agentic systems turn them into domain experts.”

## 📁 Summary

- ✔️ Legal compliance is the biggest blocker in LLM data integration  
- 🔐 Identity-aware function calling is the future of secure enterprise AI  
- 🤖 Open, collaborative agents are coming — get ready to plug in
