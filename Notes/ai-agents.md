## 🧠 Core Idea
AI agents are evolving from basic assistants into autonomous systems that:
- Make decisions
- Pull real-time data
- Communicate with other agents
- Improve over time

---

## 🧰 Key Concepts

### 🔹 AI Agents vs Assistants
- Agents operate **independently** and **proactively**
- Agents require structure, memory, and reasoning layers  
📘 [Outshift Blog – Agent Taxonomy](https://outshift.cisco.com/blog/building-ai-agents)  

### 🔹 Frameworks & Tools
- 🛠️ **LangChain**: [langchain.com](https://www.langchain.com/)
- ✍️ **Prompt Engineering**: [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide)
- 🧠 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: [RAG Overview by Meta](https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-retrieval-llm/)
- 📦 **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: [Outshift MCP Intro](https://outshift.cisco.com/blog/model-context-protocol/)
- 🤖 **Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)**: [Cisco AI Agent Stack Overview](https://outshift.cisco.com/solutions/ai-agents)

### 🔹 AI Model Selection
- 🤖 [OpenAI Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)
- 🤖 [Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude)
- 🤖 [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models)
- 📝 [Model Cards](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards) – documentation on how models behave

### 🔹 Agent Autonomy Levels
Inspired by Outshift’s 5-Level Autonomy system:
1. Deterministic automation
2. Conditional logic
3. Prompt-driven LLM
4. Tool-using agent
5. Autonomous planner with goals

## 🛠️ Example Project: Essay Writer Agent (LangChain)
Tim demoed an agent with:
- **Planning Phase** – Define topic and intent
- **Research Phase** – Pull real-time info using RAG
- **Writing Phase** – Generate structured output

Each phase used refined prompts for better accuracy.

## 🔐 Security & Agent Coordination
- **MCP** – [Model Context Protocol Overview](https://outshift.cisco.com/blog/model-context-protocol/)
- **A2A Protocol** – Enables discovery, identity verification, and secure agent interaction

## 🔮 Final Thoughts
> "AI agents are the future of intelligent automation — they’ll plan, research, decide, and collaborate. What APIs were to the 2010s, agents are to the 2020s."

Stay connected, experiment, and iterate.  
The future is autonomous — and you can build it.
